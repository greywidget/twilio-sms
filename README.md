# Twilio SMS
My first play with Twilio SMS

# Status Update
I had a bunch of issues getting started with my Trial Account.  
Eventually I got it all working and I believe the issues were due to:
- System Outages (I guess I was just unlucky)
- An issue with adding Verified Caller IDs

# Pricing
There are several moving parts and I'm not certain of them all:
- Each SMS costs about 4p
- You need to lease a Twilio Phone Number to send from which costs $1.15 per month
- There is an additional carrier charge to be added to each SMS. I think that is about 1 or 2 pence per SMS but I don't know how to predetermine the exact cost.
- I don't know it upgrading to a Paid Account means that there is another additional charge, or if it simply means that you need to add some kind of payment method.

# Conclusion
I got this all working and it's pretty cool.  
However I'm unsure of the complete pricing and Shayne Sivley on PyBites told me about nty.sh which allows free alerts (with some caveats)
So I think I'll give nty.sh a go first.
